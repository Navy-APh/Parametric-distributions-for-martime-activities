# Parametric-distributions-for-martime-activities

This repository contains the dataset used in a research study detailed in the conference paper titled "Fitting Empirical Distributions for Vessels Behavioral Analysis and Maritime Anomaly Detection".

The study presents an analysis on the duration of multiple complex maritime activities (e.g., fishing, drifting, hidden activities) that were derived by processing AIS messages. Quantitative histograms were made for each type of activity while probability and cumulative distribution functions were plotted using kernel density estimation applications. After that, multiple evaluation metrics analysed the possibilities of representing these distributions in the form of known parametric distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Gamma, Rayleigh, Log-normal).
